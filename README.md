# 3d-alignment-chart
3D Alignment Chart template made in ThreeJS + WebPack

## What is this
The code to build a 3D-Alignment-Chart frontend built using ThreeJS. I originally used a CDN to get the script files but I wanted more packages so I decided to put it in a node env.
## How to run
`npm install` to install the dependencies

`npm run dev` runs and serves you the page on your localhost, it updates and quickly builds when you save, etc.

`npm run build` runs a dev build with some debug advantages. You can host that on VSCode's Live Server (or open in browser maybe?) to check

`npm run prod` to get the bundle of files for production in the `dist` directory
